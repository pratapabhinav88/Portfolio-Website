# React Portfolio (scaffold)

This is a minimal, colourful, and interactive React portfolio scaffold built with Vite and Framer Motion.

Quick start (Windows cmd.exe):

```
cd "c:\Users\HP\Desktop\React Portfolio"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the displayed `http://localhost:5173` (or the port Vite shows).

What I included:
- `src/App.jsx` — main layout with header, hero, project grid, about, contact and footer
- `src/components/Hero.jsx` — animated hero with CTA
- `src/components/ProjectCard.jsx` — animated project cards
- `src/data/projects.js` — example project entries and gradients
- `src/styles.css` — colorful theme, gradients, and layout

Next steps I can do for you:
- Replace placeholder text and projects with your real items
- Add a contact form (Netlify/EmailJS) or a working theme switcher
- Add a projects CMS (MDX or headless CMS) and deploy to GitHub Pages / Vercel

Tell me which of the above you'd like next, and if you want me to run `npm install` here now.
